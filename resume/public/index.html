<p>I am a resourceful and passionate software engineer of 16 years.  I have experience writing both public and internal service oriented applications and finding creative solutions to complex problems.  The majority of my experience is with Java and associated frameworks like Spring.  I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work closely with data engineering and data science teams, and have a working knowledge of data pipelines, machine learning and big data.  I have a specific interest in high-performance, real-time applications and have authored production applications using functional reactive programming with Scala, Akka and Reactor.</p>
