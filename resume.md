About
I’ve been employed as a professional software engineer since 2003.  My motivation for pursuing this role has been the enjoyment and satisfaction I get when making the conceptual real.  Software as a medium provides me with a creative outlet to bring ideas to life. Early in my career, I became intimately involved in the full spectrum of technology.  While software engineering has been my primary focus, I also have gained expertise in systems and database administration.  I have been able to advance my position and achieve recognition for several of the web applications I created.  More recently, I have moved into the public- facing, web ecosystem, and continue to learn new skills and technologies during my journey.  My classification as a Senior Java developer is accurate, but not a complete representation.  I bring to any position and team, a comprehensive skill set, a thirst for knowledge, and a creative, can-do attitude.  I enjoy teaching as well as learning, and I’m always ready to take on a challenge.
